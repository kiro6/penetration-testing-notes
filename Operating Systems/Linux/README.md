# File System Hierarchy


![NEW_filesystem](https://github.com/kiro6/penetration-testing-notes/assets/57776872/fc0ea4cf-f620-4818-bfbe-0ca39823c49a)


| Path | Description  |
|----------|----------|
| / | The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root. |
| /bin | Contains essential command binaries. |
| /boot | Consists of the static bootloader, kernel executable, and files required to boot the Linux OS. |
| /dev | Contains device files to facilitate access to every hardware device attached to the system. |
| /etc | Local system configuration files. Configuration files for installed applications may be saved here as well. |
| /home | Each user on the system has a subdirectory here for storage. |
| /lib | Shared library files that are required for system boot. |
| /media | External removable media devices such as USB drives are mounted here. |
| /mnt | Temporary mount point for regular filesystems. |
| /opt | Optional files such as third-party tools can be saved here. |
| /root | The home directory for the root user. |
| /sbin | This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files). |
| /tmp | The operating system and many programs use this directory to store temporary files. This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning. |
| /usr | Contains executables, libraries, man files, etc. |
| /var | This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more. |

|  |   |_____ Permissions of the group (read, write)
|  |_________ Permissions of the owner (read, write, execute)
|____________ File type (- = File, d = Directory, l = Link, ... )
```

### Change Permissions

**Symbolic Mode**
| Symbolic Value | Explanation                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| +               | Adds permissions.                              |
| -               | Removes permissions.                           |
| =               | Sets permissions explicitly.                    |
| r               | Read permission.                               |
| w               | Write permission.                              |
| x               | Execute permission.                            |
| u               | Stands for the user or owner of the file.     |
| g               | Stands for the group that the file belongs to. |
| o               | Stands for others, which includes everyone else who is not the owner or in the group. |
| s               | Sets the Set User ID (SUID) or Set Group ID (SGID) permission on an executable file. |
| t               | Sets the "sticky bit" permission on a directory, allowing only the owner to delete or rename their own files. |



```bash
chmod u+rw,go+r example.txt
```
**Numeric Mode**
| Numeric Value | Permission       |
|---------------|-------------------|
| 4             | Read Permission  |
| 2             | Write Permission |
| 1             | Execute Permission|
| 0             | No Permission    |

```
chmod 644 example.txt

```

### Change Owner
```bash
chown <user>:<group> <file/directory>
```

### SUID & SGID
- When an executable file has the SUID/SGID permission set, it allows a user to execute the file with the permissions of user/group that owns the file .
- SUID and SGID permissions are typically designed for binary executables and not scripts for security reasons .

```bash
$ sudo chmod +s sh.sh

$ ls -lah  sh.sh 
-rwsr-sr-x 1 user user 61 Oct 12 14:47 sh.sh

```

### Sticky Bit
When the sticky bit is set on a directory, it ensures that only the owner of a file can delete or rename their own files within that directory


```bash
sudo chmod +t,o-x scripts 
sudo chmod +t reports 
$ ls -lh

drwxr-xr-t 1 user group 0 Oct 14 13:08 reports
drwxr-xr-T 1 user group 0 Oct 14 13:07 scripts
```

**Uppercase 'T' (T):** - When the sticky bit is represented as 'T', it means that the execute (x) permission for "others" is not set. 
                       - This implies that other users do not have permission to access or execute files within that directory, even if they have read or write permissions on those files.

**Lowercase 't' (t):**  - When the sticky bit is represented as 't', it means that the execute (x) permission for "others" is set. 
                        - This allows other users to access and execute files within that directory if they have appropriate permissions on the individual files, in addition to read permission on the directory.


                        
## User Management

## Service Management

### systemd 

When Linux system starts up, the bootloader loads the Linux kernel, and the init process (the first process with process ID 1) is executed which is `systemd` in many modern linux distributions 

Systemd reads the unit files from service configuration files which typically stored in : 
- `/lib/systemd/system` contains system-provided unit files, 
- `/etc/systemd/system` is for user-customized unit files.
These `unit files`  define how systemd should start, stop, and manage services. After that `systemd` start the units


**Files and directories :**
- `.target` represents a unit that defines a specific system state or target.
- `.service` is a unit type that defines a system service or program.
- `.wants` is a directory where symbolic links to dependencies are placed to establish relationships between units.
- `.socket` files in systemd represent network sockets that are used to manage communication between services and external clients.
- `.mount` files in systemd define how file systems or remote network shares should be mounted in the system.

**In unit configuration files:**
- `WantedBy` specifies the target unit that should include the current unit in its start dependencies, meaning the current unit should start when the specified target is activated.
- `Requires` indicates a mandatory dependency that must be active for the unit to start.
- `Wants` denotes an optional dependency that can be active for the unit to start.
- `After` defines units that should start after the current unit.
- `Before` specifies units that should start before the current unit.

**Special systemd units**
- `sysinit.target` is the initial system initialization target, responsible for basic system setup and early service activation. It is one of the first targets to be reached during the boot process.

- `multi-user.target` in systemd represents the system state where multiple users can log in and access the system with various services and user interfaces available, typically the default target for a multi-user mode.

- `graphical.target` in systemd represents the system state where the graphical user interface is available and is often used as the default target for systems running with a graphical desktop environment.

- there is alot more

These targets in systemd indicate synchronous points in the system boot process, providing a structured way to manage the initialization and transitioning of the system between different states or modes.

**Example of a serivce** 
```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Example Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/my-service-command
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

### systemctl 
Control the systemd system and service manager
```bash
systemctl (action) servicename          ## start,stop,enable,.....etc

systemctl list-units --type=service     ## list all services.

```
### journalctl 

It is quite possible that the services do not start due to an error. To see the problem, we can use the tool journalctl to view the logs.
```bash
$ journalctl -u ssh.service --no-pager
```

## Process Management

### PS 
The "ps" command, short for "process status," is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to view information about running processes.
```bash
# List all running processes with details
ps aux

# Filter and find specific processes by name
ps aux | grep process_name

# Display a hierarchical view of processes
ps -ejH

# List processes associated with a specific user
ps -u username

# Show processes in a tree structure
ps auxf

# Customize the output format
ps -o format

# Continuously monitor processes
watch 'ps aux | grep process_name'

# List processes sorted by CPU usage
ps -eo pid,ppid,%cpu,%mem,cmd --sort=-%cpu | head

# Show the full command line of a specific process
ps -p PID -o cmd

# Interactive real-time process monitoring tools (use in the terminal)
# top
# htop
```

### Kill a Process
A process can be in the following states:
- Running
- Waiting (waiting for an event or system resource)
- Stopped
- Zombie (stopped but still has an entry in the process table).



Processes can be controlled using `kill`, `pkill`, `pgrep`, and `killall`. 




To interact with a process, we must send a signal to it. We can view all signals with the following command:
```bash
$ kill -l

 1) SIGHUP       2) SIGINT       3) SIGQUIT      4) SIGILL       5) SIGTRAP
 6) SIGABRT      7) SIGBUS       8) SIGFPE       9) SIGKILL     10) SIGUSR1
11) SIGSEGV     12) SIGUSR2     13) SIGPIPE     14) SIGALRM     15) SIGTERM
16) SIGSTKFLT   17) SIGCHLD     18) SIGCONT     19) SIGSTOP     20) SIGTSTP
21) SIGTTIN     22) SIGTTOU     23) SIGURG      24) SIGXCPU     25) SIGXFSZ
26) SIGVTALRM   27) SIGPROF     28) SIGWINCH    29) SIGIO       30) SIGPWR
31) SIGSYS      34) SIGRTMIN    35) SIGRTMIN+1  36) SIGRTMIN+2  37) SIGRTMIN+3

43) SIGRTMIN+9  44) SIGRTMIN+10 45) SIGRTMIN+11 46) SIGRTMIN+12 47) SIGRTMIN+13
48) SIGRTMIN+14 49) SIGRTMIN+15 50) SIGRTMAX-14 51) SIGRTMAX-13 52) SIGRTMAX-12
53) SIGRTMAX-11 54) SIGRTMAX-10 55) SIGRTMAX-9  56) SIGRTMAX-8  57) SIGRTMAX-7

| Signal | Description                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | SIGHUP - This is sent to a process when the terminal that controls it is closed.                   |
| 2      | SIGINT - Sent when a user presses [Ctrl] + C in the controlling terminal to interrupt a process.     |
| 3      | SIGQUIT - Sent when a user presses [Ctrl] + D to quit.It's used to request a process to quit or terminate             |
| 9      | SIGKILL - Immediately kill a process with no clean-up operations.                                   |
| 15     | SIGTERM - Program termination.                                                                      |
| 19     | SIGSTOP - Stop the program. It cannot be handled anymore.                                            |
| 20     | SIGTSTP - Sent when a user presses [Ctrl] + Z to request for a service to suspend. The user can handle it afterward. |


### Jobs
jobs can be managed and monitored, and users can view information about running jobs, pause them, resume them, or terminate them.

#### **fg (Foreground)**
- When a process or job is in the foreground, it means that it is currently the active task that receives user input and has control over the terminal.
- Users can bring a background job into the foreground using the "fg" command, allowing them to interact with it directly

```shell

$ fg %1
$ fg PID


$ jobs                                                                                                                                             
[1]  + suspended  ping -c 100 google.com

$ fg %1
[1]  + 12447 continued  ping -c 100 google.com
PING google.com (216.58.205.206) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from mil04s29-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.205.206): icmp_seq=1 ttl=118 time=1024 ms
64 bytes from mil04s29-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.205.206): icmp_seq=2 ttl=118 time=86.2 ms
64 bytes from mil04s29-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.205.206): icmp_seq=3 ttl=118 time=70.0 ms


```

#### **bg (Background)**
- Background processes or jobs run independently of the foreground and do not typically receive user input directly.
- That does not mean that the output of the jobs will not appear , if you don't want it to appear redirect the output

```shell

$ bg %1
$ bg PID


$ jobs
[1]  + suspended  ping -c 100 google.com

$ bg %1
[1]  + 12490 continued  ping -c 100 google.com
 64 bytes from mil04s29-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.205.206): icmp_seq=3 ttl=118 time=90.1 ms
64 bytes from mil04s29-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.205.206): icmp_seq=4 ttl=118 time=103 ms
64 bytes from mil04s29-in-f14.1e100.net (216.58.205.206): icmp_seq=5 ttl=118 time=56.7 ms

```

#### **nohup (No Hang-Up):**
- When a command is executed with nohup it means that the command will continue running even if the terminal session is closed or disconnected
- nohup redirects the standard output and standard error to a file called "nohup.out" in the user's home directory by default
```shell

$ nohup ping -c 10  google.com &                                                                                                                      1 ↵
[1] 13149
nohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out'         

```

#### **disown**
- The disown command in Unix-like operating systems is used to remove background jobs from the shell's job table.
- This is useful if you want to keep a background job running even after you've logged out or closed your terminal session.
```shell

$ disown %1

$ disown PID

```
## Task Scheduling

### Crons 

- System-Wide Cron Jobs stored in /etc/cron.d ,/etc/cron.daily ,/etc/cron.hourly ,/etc/cron.monthly ,/etc/crontab ,/etc/cron.weekly
- User Cron Jobs stored in /var/spool/cron

**Cron Syntax**

```
* * * * * command-to-be-executed
| | | | |
| | | | +----- Day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday is both 0 and 7)
| | | +------- Month (1 - 12)
| | +--------- Day of the month (1 - 31)
| +----------- Hour (0 - 23)
+------------- Minute (0 - 59)
```

**Cron Special Strings**
- @reboot: This special string schedules a job to run when the system reboots.

- @yearly or @annually: These strings are equivalent and schedule a job to run once a year at midnight on January 1st (0 0 1 1 *).

- @monthly: This string schedules a job to run once a month at midnight on the 1st of the month (0 0 1 * *).

- @weekly: This string schedules a job to run once a week at midnight on Sunday (0 0 * * 0).

- @daily or @midnight: These strings are equivalent and schedule a job to run once a day at midnight (0 0 * * *).

- @hourly: This string schedules a job to run once an hour at the beginning of the hour (0 * * * *).

#### crontab
```
crontab -e ## Edit the Cron Table

crontab -l ## View Your Cron Jobs

```

**Example Cron Job**

```shell
crontab -e

@reboot echo "cron worked" > ~/cron_output.txt   ## write in the crontab page this will echo this text every time the system boots

```


# System Files

- **/etc/fstab** :  It serves as a central configuration file that lists the filesystems to be automatically mounted during system boot.

### usage

```shell
setcap cap_net_bind_service+ep /path/to/executable
```

```shell
getcap /path/to/executable
```

### options

#### **+p (Permitted Privileges):**
**Usage:**
- Grants permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable.

**Definition:**
- Permitted privileges mean that the capability is permitted to the executable, indicating that it has the potential to use it during execution.
- However, the capability is not necessarily activated immediately. Instead, the executable has the permission to utilize this capability if needed, as specified by the system's security policies.
- The capability remains available for activation at a later point during execution if required by the program's logic or circumstances.

#### **+ep (Effective and Permitted Privileges):**
**Usage:**
- Grants both effective and permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable.

**Definition:**
- Effective privileges mean that the capability is both permitted and immediately utilized by the executable when it is executed. This indicates that the executable can perform actions that the capability allows from the beginning of its execution.
- The operating system enforces the necessary checks and permissions at runtime, allowing the executable to exercise the capability without requiring explicit activation steps.
- The capability is actively utilized as part of the executable's primary functionality or operations.

#### **+ei (Effective and Inheritable Privileges):**
**Usage:**
