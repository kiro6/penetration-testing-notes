## SMB
Server Message Block (SMB) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network

- `CIFS` was used as the same as SMB but now it's old and work on the same ports as SMB

### port used

-  `NEW` 445 TCP on top of `microsoft-ds`

### Forced Authentication Attacks
#### Responder
- if we are in the same network we can pretend to be a smb server and catch the user hashes 
```
1) The local host file (C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts) will be checked for suitable records.
2) If no records are found, the machine switches to the local DNS cache, which keeps track of recently resolved names.
3) Is there no local DNS record? A query will be sent to the DNS server that has been configured.
4) If all else fails, the machine will issue a multicast query, requesting the IP address of the file share from other machines on the network.
```
- user mistyped a shared folder's name `\\mysharefoder\` instead of `\\mysharedfolder\` In that case, the machine will send a multicast query to all devices on the network

```
 responder -I <interface name>
```

#### relay attack 
- will capture credintials and pass it using techniques like `PtH` to another systems 
- [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/)
```shell
#  we need to set SMB to OFF in our responder configuration file (/etc/responder/Responder.conf).
cat /etc/responder/Responder.conf | grep 'SMB ='

- NFS is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers.

## SNMP
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) was created to monitor network devices. 
- In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely. 

**Components of SNMP:**
- SNMP Manager: The central management station responsible for monitoring and managing network devices. It sends SNMP requests to agents and receives responses.
- SNMP Agent: Software running on network devices that collects and maintains management information. Agents respond to SNMP requests from managers and can also send notifications (traps) to managers.
- MIB: Management Information Base is a collection of hierarchical data definitions that describe the managed objects in a device.  Each object has a unique identifier (OID) and can be read, written, or polled via SNMP.

**versions**
- SNMPv1:
  - Lacks built-in authentication and encryption.
  - Vulnerable to unauthorized access and interception of data.
  - Still used in some small networks but considered insecure for larger or sensitive environments.
- SNMPv2 (SNMPv2c):
  - use community strings for auth.
  - Community strings transmitted in plain text, lacking encryption.
- SNMPv3:
  - Introduces authentication using username and password.
  - Supports transmission encryption via pre-shared key.

## Oracle TNS
The Oracle Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks.

**Components**
- Listener: A process on the server side that listens for incoming connection requests from clients and establishes communication channels with the appropriate database instances.
- Service Name: A logical name associated with a specific database service or instance, used by clients to identify and connect to the desired database.
- Connect Descriptor: Contains information necessary for a client to establish a connection to an Oracle database, including network protocol, server hostname or IP address, port number, and service name.
- Listener.ora: A configuration file defining settings for the Listener process, including protocol addresses, offered services, and security settings.
- Tnsnames.ora: A configuration file used by Oracle clients to resolve service names to connect descriptors, facilitating easy identification and connection to Oracle databases.

| rcp     | rshd           | 514  | TCP                | Copy a file or directory bidirectionally from the local system to the remote system (or vice versa) or from one remote system to another. It works like the cp command on Linux but provides no warning to the user for overwriting existing files on a system. |
| rsh     | rshd           | 514  | TCP                | Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure. Relies upon the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files for validation. |
| rexec   | rexecd         | 512  | TCP                | Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a username and password through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files. |
| rlogin  | rlogind        | 513  | TCP                | Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to telnet but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhosts files. |

### RDP Session Hijacking
- we need to have `SYSTEM` privileges and use the Microsoft `tscon.exe` binary
- we can use several methods to obtain SYSTEM privileges, such as `PsExec` or `Mimikatz`.
