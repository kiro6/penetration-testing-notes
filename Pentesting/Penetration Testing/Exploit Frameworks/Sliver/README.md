# Sliver Communication Protocols

## Choosing the Right Protocol

The selection of a protocol depends on the specific network environment and the attackerâ€™s objectives:

- **Stealth**: DNS and HTTPS are preferred in highly monitored networks.
- **High Bandwidth**: mTLS and HTTPS are better for large data transfers.
- **Internal Pivoting**: Named pipes and TCP pivots are essential for moving laterally within an environment.
- **Bypassing Restrictions**: DNS can bypass most outbound traffic filters.


# Implants 
- Implants are the software (binaries/executables), They offer network connections on different sets of protocols and a means of communication between a C2 server and the target workstation/server.
- Implants can operate in beacon and session modes.
  - **Sessions:** use long-polling connections, which means they use a single TCP connection which is constantly open.
  - **Beacons:** on the other hand call back periodically, and will sleep when not active which can help keep their presence hidden.
## Jitter
- Jitter is a randomization mechanism that alters the interval at which beacon signals are sent to the C2 server.
- Example: If a beacon is set to signal every 60 seconds with a 20% jitter, the actual interval will vary randomly between 48 and 72 seconds.
