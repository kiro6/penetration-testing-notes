# Interface Modes

## Monitor Mode
- Monitor Mode allows a wireless interface to capture all packets in its range, regardless of the intended recipient.
- It is essential for network analysis, penetration testing, and troubleshooting.
```bash
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```

## Managed Mode
- Managed mode is when we want our interface to act as a client or a station. In other words, this mode allows us to authenticate and associate to an access point, basic service set, and others. 
- In this mode, our card will actively search for nearby networks (APs) to which we can establish a connection
```bash
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid HTB-Wifi
```
## Master Mode
- In master mode, the device creates its own network and allows other devices to connect to it, acting as a router or AP.
```bash
nano open.conf

interface=wlan0
driver=nl80211
ssid=HTB-Hello-World
channel=2
hw_mode=g


sudo hostapd open.conf
```

## Ad-hoc Mode
- Ad-hoc mode allows wireless devices to communicate directly with each other without needing a central router or access point. It's like a peer-to-peer connection where devices can talk to each other directly.
- This mode is commonly used in mesh networks (like those in homes or offices), where multiple access points (APs) work together to cover a larger area. In mesh systems, ad-hoc mode is typically used for communication between the APs (called backhaul), to extend the range of the network.
- Itâ€™s important to note that ad-hoc mode is different from extender mode. In extender mode, two interfaces (like Wi-Fi devices) are connected in a way that one acts as a bridge to extend the network. Ad-hoc mode, on the other hand, is more about direct communication between devices without the need for an intermediary like an access point.

```bash
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid HTB-Wifi
```

## Mesh Mode

- In a mesh network, each device (often called a mesh point) works as a node in the network. The devices are connected to each other, allowing data to pass through multiple devices until it reaches its destination.
- When you set your device to mesh mode, it becomes part of this mesh network. The device can join other mesh points and route data between them. This mode is commonly used in scenarios where large coverage is needed, such as in businesses, campuses, or industrial spaces.
```bash
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type mesh
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```
