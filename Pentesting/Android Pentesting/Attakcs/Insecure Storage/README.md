## Storage in Android 
### Internal Storage
- Private to your app.
- Stored in `/data/data/<your_package_name>/files/`
- Other apps and the user normally canâ€™t access it directly (without root).
- Data is deleted automatically when the app is uninstalled.
- Example use: saving sensitive information like tokens, config files, or app-specific data.
```java
File file = new File(context.getFilesDir(), "myfile.txt");
```
### External Storage
- Shared across apps.
- stored in `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/<package_name>/files/`
- Can be removable (like an SD card) or emulated internal storage.
- Data here is public (unless you use scoped storage with app-specific dirs).
- Apps can still use the permission `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` on Android 13+ to request access to all files on external storage, expect scoped ones
- Example use: media files (photos, downloads, large assets).
```java
File file = new File(context.getExternalFilesDir(null), "myfile.txt");
```
### Shared Preferences
- Data is private to your app and persists after the app restarts.
- Stored in  `/data/data/<package_name>/shared_prefs/`
- Stores key-value pairs (like a dictionary).
- Good for lightweight data (settings, flags, login state).
```java
SharedPreferences prefs = context.getSharedPreferences("MyPrefs", MODE_PRIVATE);
SharedPreferences.Editor editor = prefs.edit();
editor.putString("username", "kiro");
editor.apply();
```
### Databases (SQLite / Room)
- Data is private to your app and persists after the app restarts.
- Stored in  `/data/data/<package_name>/databases/`  
- Structured storage for relational data.
- Suitable for complex data with relations (users, orders, notes).
- SQLite is built-in, but Room provides an easier abstraction.
```java
SQLiteDatabase db = context.openOrCreateDatabase("MyDB", MODE_PRIVATE, null);
db.execSQL("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users(id INTEGER, name TEXT)");
```
### Cache Files
- Stored in getCacheDir() (internal)  `/data/data/<package_name>/cache/`   or getExternalCacheDir() (external) `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/<package_name>/cache/` .
- Temporary data used to make apps faster.
- System may delete cache anytime if space is needed.
- You should not store important data here.
```java
File cacheFile = new File(context.getCacheDir(), "temp.txt");
```
