### Fictional Scenarios

### Token Smuggling
This technique attempts to hide requests for harmful or restricted content by manipulating input tokens, such as splitting words into multiple tokens or using different encodings, to avoid initial recognition of blocked words.

### Suffix & Adversarial Suffix
Since LLMs are text completion algorithms at their core, an attacker can append a suffix to their malicious prompt to try to nudge the model into completing the request. Adversarial suffixes are advanced variants specifically designed to coerce LLMs into ignoring restrictions. They often look nonsensical to the human eye.

### Opposite/Sudo Mode
Convince the LLM to operate in a different mode where restrictions do not apply.
