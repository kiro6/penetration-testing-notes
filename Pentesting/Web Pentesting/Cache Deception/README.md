## Web cache deception
Web cache deception is a vulnerability that enables an attacker to trick a web cache into storing sensitive, dynamic content. It's caused by discrepancies between how the cache server and origin server handle requests. 
- `Web cache poisoning` manipulates cache keys to inject malicious content into a cached response, which is then served to other users.
- `Web cache deception` exploits cache rules to trick the cache into storing sensitive or private content, which the attacker can then access.

## Cache rules
- Static file extension rules - These rules match the file extension of the requested resource,
  - .css, .js.
- Static directory rules - These rules match all URL paths that start with a specific prefix. These are often used to target specific directories that contain only static resources,
  - /static, /assets, /wp-content, /media, /templates, /public, /shared
- File name rules - These rules match specific file names to target files that are universally required for web operations and change rarely,
  - such as robots.txt and favicon.ico.

## Detecting cached responses
- X-Cache header provides information about whether a response was served from the cache. Typical values include:
  - X-Cache: hit - The response was served from the cache.
  - X-Cache: miss - The cache did not contain a response for the request's key, so it was fetched from the origin server. In most cases, the response is then cached. To confirm this, send the request again to see whether the value updates to hit.
  - X-Cache: dynamic - The origin server dynamically generated the content. Generally this means the response is not suitable for caching.
  - X-Cache: refresh - The cached content was outdated and needed to be refreshed or revalidated.
- [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control) header may include a directive that indicates caching, like public with a max-age higher than 0. This only suggests that the resource is cacheable. It isn't always indicative of caching, as the cache may sometimes override this header.

# Exploiting Cache Deception
Identify a discrepancy in how the cache and origin server parse the URL path. This could be a discrepancy in how they:
- Map URLs to resources.
  - Path Params `/MyAccount/param1`
- Process delimiter characters.

## Exploiting static extension cache rules
Cache rules often target static resources by matching common file extensions like `.css` or `.js` . This is the default behavior in most CDNs. 
### 1) Path mapping discrepancies
`http://example.com/path/resource/param1/param2` => `http://example.com/user/123/profile/wcd.css`
### 2) Delimiter discrepancies
1) Test the endpoint `/settings/users/list` => `/settings/users/listaaa`, you'll use this response as a reference when you start testing delimiter characters.
> Note: If the response is identical to the original response, this indicates that the request is being redirected. You'll need to choose a different endpoint to test. 
2) Test `settings/users/list;aaa`, or any other delimiter
    - If the response is identical to the base response, this indicates that the `;` character is used as a delimiter and the origin server interprets the path as /settings/users/list.✅
    - If it matches the response to the path with the arbitrary string, this indicates that the `;` character isn't used as a delimiter and the origin server interprets the path as `/settings/users/list;aaa`. ❌
> Note: Some delimiter characters may be processed by the victim's browser before it forwards the request to the cache. This means that some delimiters can't be used in an exploit. For example, browsers URL-encode characters like {, }, <, and >, and use # to truncate the path. If the cache or origin server decodes these characters, it may be possible to use an encoded version in an exploit.

### 3) Delimiter Decoding Discrepancies
Differences in which delimiter characters are decoded by the cache and origin server can result in discrepancies in how they interpret the URL path, even if they both use the same characters as delimiters. Consider the example `/profile%23wcd.css`, which uses the URL-encoded `#` character
- The origin server decodes `%23` to `#`. It uses `#` as a delimiter, so it interprets the path as /profile and returns profile information.
- The cache also uses the `#` character as a delimiter, but doesn't decode `%23`. It interprets the path as `/profile%23wcd.css`. If there is a cache rule for the `.css extension` it will store the response.


Some cache servers may **decode the URL and then forward the request** with the decoded characters. Others first apply **cache rules based on the encoded URL, then decode the URL and forward** it to the next server. Consider the example `/myaccount%3fwcd.css`. 

- The cache server applies the cache rules based on the encoded path `/myaccount%3fwcd.css` and decides to store the response as there is a cache rule for the `.css` extension. It then decodes `%3f` to `?` and forwards the rewritten request to the origin server.
- The origin server receives the request `/myaccount?wcd.css`. It uses the `?` character as a delimiter, so it interprets the path as `/myaccount`.
