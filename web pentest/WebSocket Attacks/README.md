#### The WebSocket handshake is initiated with an HTTP request similar to this:
```http
GET /echo HTTP/1.1
Host: websockets.htb
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Sec-WebSocket-Key: 7QpTshdCiQfiv3tH7myJ1g==
Origin: http://websockets.htb
```
- The Connection header with the value Upgrade and the Upgrade header with the value websocket indicate the client's intent to establish a WebSocket connection
- The Sec-WebSocket-Version header contains the WebSocket protocol version chosen by the client, with the latest version being 13
- The Sec-WebSocket-Key header contains a unique value confirming that the client wants to establish a WebSocket connection; this header does not provide any security protections
- The Origin header contains the origin just like in regular HTTP requests and is used for security purposes.

#### The server responds with a response similar to the following:
```http
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: QU/gD/2y41z9ygrOaGWgaC+Pm2M=
```
- The HTTP status code of 101 indicates that the WebSocket connection establishment has been completed
- The Connection and Upgrade headers contain the same values as in the client's request, which is Upgrade and websocket, respectively
- The Sec-WebSocket-Accept header contains a value derived from the value sent by the client in the Sec-WebSocket-Key header and confirms that the server is willing to establish a WebSocket connection
